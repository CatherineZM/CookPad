# COOKPAD
Cookpad is a recipe sharing app that allows food lovers to write food blogs and recipes and beginners to learn cooking. 

## Basic Features
In our web app, users will be able to post their recipes with steps and ingredients. To search for a recipe, users can apply different filters to filter out unwanted recipes. They can also add a recipe to their own collection so that it is easier for them to replicate it. Users can also give likes to a recipes and they will be able to get a sense of whether the recipe is worth trying by looking at the number of likes. The homepage will also display the top recipes for users in a slideshow.
